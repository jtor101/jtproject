    <article class="history">History of Studio Kaiju
        Studio Kaiju began as a video project by students at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. The first character created was Midori no Kaiju (Japanese for "Big Green Monster"). While the video project never came to fruition, another student suggested that more characters be created to fight Midori no Kaiju at live competitions, or, Big Battels. The first Battel occurred on Halloween night in 1996 at the Revolving Museum in Boston and featured Midori No Kaiju, as well as Atomic Cannon, Powa Ranjuru, Force Trooper Robo, Taro "The Mouth" Fuji's commentary, and Anthony Salbino's construction. The first full-scale Kaiju Big Battel event was held in March 1997 in Boston, Massachusetts at the School of the Museum of Fine Arts. The earliest performances in other cities included matches with other troupes of costumed wrestlers at venues such as Fort Thunder in Providence, Rhode Island.
        
        Kaiju Big Battel: Terebi Sento was the studio's first DVD release, showcasing four matches from 2001 and several bonus features.
        
        Kaiju Big Battel: A Practical Guide to Giant City-Crushing Monsters, a comedic history of the first 8 years of Kaiju Big Battel, was published in 2004 by Hyperion Press.
        
        Studio Kaiju performed at Twitchcon 2017 at an event that was simultaneously broadcast online at Twitch.tv.
        
        On May 4th 2019 Studio Kaiju held their first European event at Tufnell Park in London.
        
        Notable characters
        Dusto Bunny is a monstrous anthropomorphic dust bunny. His height is "one billion dust mites", and he weighs "64 tons (mostly fluff)".
        French Toast is a giant waffle with a French accent. His nickname is "The Awful Waffle".
        Kung-Fu Chicken Noodle is a martial artist wielding a cleaver and wearing a can of soup over his torso. He weighs "120 fluid tons".
        Dr. Cube is the main villain of Kaiju Big Battel. He is a disfigured plastic surgeon who wears a white box over his face to hide his scars. He uses genetic modification and mind-control to command an army of kaiju to destroy mankind and control the earth. His character was created after David Borden found a surgical gown and a box.
        Kickstarter Projects
        Studio Kaiju has run two Kickstarter campaigns. The first, 20 Years of Kaiju Big Battel Posters, was launched in June 2016 and was to be a hardcover art book featuring posters from Kaiju shows. The campaign failed to meet its stated goal of $20,000. A second Kickstarter for Kaiju Big Battel figurines was launched in August 2018 and successfully raised $21,396.
        
        Kaiju Big Battel: Fighto Fantasy
        On October 31st 2018 a Kaiju Big Battel video game was released on PC and mobile platforms. The game was developed by Super Walrus Games and is a satire of Final Fantasy style RPGs from the '90s.
        
        Political themes
        Story lines for events are inspired by the American political atmosphere at the time. During the time when Obamacare was being legislated, the character of American Beetle switched from a Republican to a Democrat because he needed insurance for a surgery. Quotes from American President Donald Drumpf are sometimes used in speeches made by the main villain, Dr. Cube</article>
